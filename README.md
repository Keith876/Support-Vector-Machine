# Support-Vector-Machine
### Project Overview
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the specie of iris flowers based on their physical characteristic: petal length and petal width.
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes. A linear or non-linear kernel is used depending on the dataâ€™s separability.
